A fun and interactive Number Guessing Game built in C! This game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

### 🎮 How to Play:  
1. The game randomly chooses a number between 1 and 100.  
2. You have 5 attempts to guess the number.  
3. After each guess, the game gives a hint:  
   - **Too High**: Your guess is greater than the number.  
   - **Too Low**: Your guess is less than the number.  
4. If you guess it right, you win! Otherwise, the correct number is revealed once attempts are exhausted.
